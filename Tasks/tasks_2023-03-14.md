## Even or odd

Write a function `is_even` that:

1. Takes a single parameter `number`.
2. Uses the modulo operator `%` to calculate the remainder of a division by `2`.
3. Checks if the remainder is either `0` (even), or `1` (odd).
4. Uses a `return` statement to return a boolean result of either `True` or `False`, indicating whether `number` is even, or not.
5. Passes the tests defined below.

### Tests

Your function must pass the following tests:

> **To run the tests, execute them on the console.**

```python
assert is_even(4)
assert not is_even(7)
assert is_even(0)
assert not is_even(1)
```

### Solution

```python

# Place your solution here for review
def is_even(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return True
  return False

```

### Extra tasks

1. Write an additional function `is_odd` that calls `is_even` to compute its result.

```python
# Place your solution here for review
def is_odd(number):
  if is_even(number):
    return False
  return True
```

2. Using `assert`, write some tests to show that your `is_odd` function works.

```python
# Place your solution here for review
assert not is_odd(4)       # Should return False
assert is_odd(5)           # Should return True
```

3. Find a way to write `is_even` without using any `if` or `if-else` statements.

```python
# Place your solution here for review
def is_even_no_if(number):
  return number % 2 == 0
```

4. Find a way to write `is_even` without using any `if` or `if-else` statements.

```python
# Place your solution here for review
def is_odd_no_if(number):
  return False == is_even_no_if(number) # This is basically (number % 2 != 0)
  return not is_even_no_if(number)
```

## Speed of moving object

Imagine the following scenario:
we know the speed of a moving object, such as a vehicle, animal, or celestial body.
We'll describe the speed using common examples:

> “The object is moving faster than a cheetah.”

Write a function `moving_faster_than` that:

1. Takes as its only parameter the speed of a moving object, in meters per second.  

2. Uses multiple `if`-statements to compare the object's speed to known speeds:

    * Greater than 1 m/s: faster than a snail

    * Greater than 10 m/s: faster than a bat

    * Greater than 30 m/s: faster than a cheetah

    * Greater than 330 m/s: faster than sound

    * Greater than 1000 m/s: faster than a bullet

3. Displays appropriate messages using the `print()` function from within the `if` suites:

    > “The object is moving faster than …”

```python
# Place your solution here for review
def moving_faster_than(object_speed):
  if object_speed > 1000:
    print('The object is faster than a bullet')
  elif object_speed > 330:
    print('The object is faster than sound')
  elif object_speed > 30:
    print('The object is faster than a cheetah')
  elif object_speed > 10:
    print('The object is faster than a bat')
  elif object_speed > 1:
    print('The object is faster than a snail')
```

### Extra tasks

1. Add an `assert` statement to ensure the given speed is a positive number.

2. Find a way to only use the `print()` function once, after all the `if`-statemens have executed.

```python
# Place your function here for review
assert test_speed >= 0, 'Speed is not a positive value!'
```

```python
def moving_faster_than(object_speed):
  print('This is a comparasion of your object speed ' + str(object_speed) + ' m/s and various objects.')
  if object_speed > 1000: 
    return print('After detailed scientific analysis we can conclude: The object is faster than a bullet, sound, a cheetah, a bat, and of course, a snail.')
  if object_speed > 330:
    return print('After detailed scientific analysis we can conclude: The object is faster than sound, a cheetah, a bat, and of course, a snail.')
  if object_speed > 30:
    return print('After detailed scientific analysis we can conclude: The object is faster than a cheetah, a bat, and of course, a snail.')
  if object_speed > 10:
    return print('After detailed scientific analysis we can conclude: The object is faster than a bat and the slow-moving but mighty snail.')
  if object_speed > 1:
    return print('The object is faster than a snail')
  return print('The object is slower than a snail. Slow as a snail as they say')
```

```python
def moving_faster_than(object_speed):
  assert test_speed >= 0, 'Speed is not a positive value!'
  message = 'The object is faster '
  if object_speed > 1000:
    message += 'a bullet'
  elif object_speed > 330:
    message += 'sound'
  elif object_speed > 30:
    message += 'a cheetah'
  elif object_speed > 10:
    message += 'a bat'
  elif object_speed > 1:
    message += 'a snail'
  print(message)
```

## Product description

Write a function `describe_product` that:

1. Takes three parameters:

   * `name`: str
   * `kind`: str
   * `price`: int

2. Returns a description of the product, including the received values, as a string. Example:

    > “A banana is a fruit and costs 35 cents.”

```python
# Place your function here for review
def describe_product(name, kind, price):
  return print("A " + name + " is a " + kind + " and costs " + str(price) + " cents")
```
