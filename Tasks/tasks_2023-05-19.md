# Tasks

These tasks revolve around Python's built-in data structures.

## Python Data Structures

> “If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. **Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.**” — [Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming
](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html)

| Data structure | Mutable | Ordered | Named items | Unique items |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Tuple | No | Yes | No | No |
| Set | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Dict | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| List | Yes | Yes | No | No |

## More tuples

Tuples are Python's simplest data structure.
Idea with tuples is: use them to bind together a few different—often *heterogenous*— values under one name.
Hence my description of tuples as “poor man's objects”.

Properties of tuples:

1. Items can be accessed via unpacking
    * Use underscores `_` for unneeded fields
2. Items are ordered
2. Access individual items using indices
    * Remember they start at `0`
3. Tuples are *immutable*: items cannot be changed

### Record velocity

Write a function `record_velocity()`, that:

1. Takes two parameters with default values, `distance=(1, 'm')` and `time='s'`.

2. Returns a tuple containing the recorded velocity.

3. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
assert record_velocity() == ((1, 'm'), 's')
assert record_velocity((50, 'm')) == ((50, 'm'), 's')
assert record_velocity((36, 'km'), 'h') == ((36, 'km'), 'h')
```

### Implementation

```python

def record_velocity(distance=(1,'m'), time='s'):
  if distance[1] == 'km':
    time = 'h'
  return distance, time
```

### Extra tasks

1. Write a utility function `_condense_unit()`, that passes the following tests:

    ```python
    speed = ((50, 'm'), 's')
    assert _condense_unit(speed) == (50, 'm/s')
    ```
    > Hint: Unpacking of nested tuples can get tricky and might require extra parantheses to work. In a bind, resort to indexing tuple items numerically.

2. Write a utility function `_expand_unit()`, that passes the following tests:

    ```python
    speed = (50, 'm/s')
    assert _expand_unit(speed) == ((50, 'm'), 's')
    assert _condense_unit(_expand_unit(speed)) == speed
    ```

    > Hint: use Python's `str.split()` function to split a string by a given delimiter.

### Implementation

```python
def _condense_unit(distance=(1,'m'), time='s'):
  speed_value, lenght_unit = distance[0]
  if time == 's':
    condensed_unit = 'm/s'
  elif time == 'h': 
    condensed_unit = 'km/h'
  return (speed_value, condensed_unit)

def _expand_unit(speed=(1, 'm/s')):
  if speed[1]== 'm/s':
    expanded_speed = (speed[0], 'm'), 's'
  else:
    expanded_speed = (speed[0], 'km'), 'h'
  return expanded_speed
```

### Simple speed conversion

Write two functions `ms_to_kmh()` and `kmh_to_ms()` that:

1. Take a tuple consisting of a `value` and a `unit`, representing speed — see tests for details.

2. Convert the speed to `m/s` or `km/h`, respectively.

3. Pass the following tests.

> Hint: you do not need to consider any error handling for these functions.

#### Tests

```python
speed_in_ms = (50, 'm/s')
assert ms_to_kmh(speed_in_ms) == (180, 'km/h')

speed_in_kmh = (36, 'km/h')
assert kmh_to_ms(speed_in_kmh) == (10, 'm/s')
```

#### Implementation

```python
def ms_to_kmh(speed=(1,'m/s')):
  converted_speed = speed[0]*3.6, 'km/h'
  return converted_speed

def kmh_to_ms(speed=(1,'km/h')):
  converted_speed = speed[0]/3.6, 'm/s'
  return converted_speed
```

### Smart speed conversion

Write a function `convert_speed()`, that:

1. Takes a 2-tuple representing speed.

1. Takes an optional `to = 'm/s'` parameter.

2. Uses the value in the `to` parameter to to determine which conversion to carry out.

3. Uses the `speed_in_ms()` or `kmh_to_ms()` functions to carry out the desired conversion.

3. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```
speed_in_ms = (50, 'm/s')
speed_in_kmh = (36, 'km/h')

assert convert_speed(speed_in_ms) == speed_in_ms
assert convert_speed(speed_in_kmh) == kmh_to_ms(speed_in_kmh)

assert convert_speed(speed_in_ms, to = 'm/s') == speed_in_ms
assert convert_speed(speed_in_kmh, to = 'm/s') == kmh_to_ms(speed_in_kmh)

assert convert_speed(speed_in_ms, to = 'km/h') == ms_to_kmh(speed_in_ms)
assert convert_speed(speed_in_kmh, to = 'km/h') == speed_in_kmh
```

#### Implementation

```python
def convert_speed(speed=(1,'m/s'), to='m/s'):
  if to == 'm/s' and speed[1] == 'km/h':
    new_speed = kmh_to_ms(speed)
  elif to == 'km/h' and speed[1] == 'm/s':
    new_speed = ms_to_kmh(speed)
  else:
    new_speed = speed
  return new_speed
```

## Address book

This set of tasks introduces you to two of Python's *mutable* data structures: lists and dicts.

### Create address book

Write a factory function `Contacts` that:

1. Takes a single parameter `contacts` with default value of `contacts=[]`.
2. Returns the `contacts` list.
3. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
assert Contacts([]) == []
assert Contacts() is Contacts()
```

#### Implementation

```python
def Contacts(contacts=[]):
  return contacts
```

### Create contact

Write a factory function `Contact` that:

1. Takes a single `name` parameter.
2. Returns a `dict` with key `name` mapped to the supplied name.
3. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
assert Contact("Walter White") == {'name': "Walter White"}
```

#### Implementation

```python
def Contact(name):
  return {'name':name}
```

### Add field to contact

Write a function `add_field` that:

1. Takes as parameters a `contact`, as returned by `Contact()`, as well as a `field` name and a corresponding `value`.
2. Returns the updated contact.
3. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
contact = Contact("Walter White")
add_field(contact, 'email', 'walter.white@example.com')
assert contact['email'] == 'walter.white@example.com'
```

#### Implementation

```python
def add_field(contact, field, value):
  contact[field] = value
  return contact
```

#### Extra tasks

1. Update `add_field()` to print a warning when an existing field is overwritten.

    > Hint: use the `in` operator to check for existance of a key in a dict.

#### Implementation

```python
def add_field(contact, field, value):
  if field in contact:
    print("Value is being overwritten")
  contact[field] = value
  return contact
```

### Add contact to address book

Write a function `add_contact`, that:

1. Takes a single `contact` parameter.
2. Retrieves the list of contacts by calling `Contacts()`.
3. Adds the contact to the list.
4. Returns the list of contacts.
5. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
contacts = Contacts([])
walter = Contact("Walter White")
contacts = add_contact(walter)
assert len(contacts) == 1
assert contacts[0]['name'] == "Walter White"
contacts = add_contact(Contact('Jack'))
assert len(contacts) == 2
```

#### Implementation

```python
def add_contact(contact):
  contacts = Contacts()
  contacts.append(contact)
  return contacts
```

## Products and taxes

### Tax rates revisited

Write a function `get_tax_rates()` that:

1. Returns a `dict` with two tax categories `standard` and `consumable`, mapped to rates `19` and `7` percent, respectively.
2. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
assert get_tax_rates() == {'standard': 19, 'consumable': 7}
```

#### Implementation

```python
def get_tax_rates():
  dict = {'standard': 19, 'consumable': 7}
  return dict
```

### Products revisited

Write a factory function `Product()` that:

1. Takes as parameters `name`, `kind`, and `price`.
2. Uses an `assert` statement to ensure the kind is one of the tax categories returned by `get_tax_rates()`.

    > Hint: use the `in` operator to check for existance of a key in a dict.

3. Returns a `dict` representing the product.

4. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
banana = Product('Banana', 'consumable', 20)
assert banana['name'] == 'Banana'
assert banana['kind'] == 'consumable'
assert banana['price'] == 20
```

#### Implementation

```python
def Product(name, kind, price):
  assert kind in get_tax_rates()
  return {'name' : name, 'kind': kind, 'price': price}
```

### Conditional sales tax revisited

Write a function `calculate_tax()` that:

1. Takes a single `product` as returned by `Product()`.
2. Calls `get_tax_rates()` to retrieve the defined tax rates.
3. Uses the `kind` of the product to choose the appropriate tax rate.
4. Calculates and returns the applicable tax.
5. Passes the following tests.

#### Tests

```python
mango = Product('Mango', 'consumable', 100)
assert calculate_tax(mango) == 7

ball = Product('Ball', 'standard', 2000)
assert calculate_tax(ball) == 380
```

#### Implementation

```python
def calculate_tax(product):
  tax_rates = get_tax_rates()
  tax_rate = tax_rates[product['kind']] * 0.01
  price = product['price']
  applicable_tax =  tax_rate * float(price)
  return int(applicable_tax)
```
